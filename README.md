## Description

With this field plug-in, when a specific choice is selected, a text box appears where the enumerator can enter a text response. This is helpful for fields that have an "Other" choice, so the enumerator can enter the "Other" response right on the same page. This works with both [*select_one*](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/03h.field-types-select-one.html) and [*select_multiple*](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/03i.field-types-select-multiple.html) fields.

<table><tr><td><strong>Important</strong>: Make sure you add a field to retrieve the metadata, or the text box data will not be available in the data export. See <em><a href="#data-format">Data format</a></em> below for more info.</td></tr></table>

## Features

* Able to enter a text response when a specific choice is selected (often called the "Other" choice).
* Customize which choice will make the text box appear.
* Text box appears right below "Other" choice when selected.
* All of the capabilities of the [select_one-select_multiple](https://github.com/surveycto/select_one-select_multiple/blob/master/README.md) field plug-in.

### Requirements

Android: Android 7 or up

iOS and web browsers: Because web browsers and iOS devices are kept more up-to-date with the latest features, nearly all web browsers and iOS devices should support the field plug-in, but test it on your collection device beforehand to be sure.

## Data format

The field value will be the selected choice.

The data in the text box will be stored in the field plug-in metadata. To retrieve that text box data, use this expression:

    item-at('|', plug-in-metadata(${basic_hint-so}), 1)

You can add a [*calculate* field](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/03zb.field-types-calculate.html) with that *calculation*. Check out our documentation on [using expressions](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/09.expressions.html) to learn about the functions used.

The item-at() function is used because other data is stored in the metadata for internal purposes. You can use the above expression to retrieve just the text box data.

The metadata will store the data in the text box, even if the text box is hidden (such as if "Other" was previously selected). If you'd like, you can give that *calculate* field a *[relevance](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/08.relevance.html)* expression so that it is only relevant if the "Other" choice was selected. For example, if the "Other" choice has a choice *value* of "97", you can give the *calculate* field that retreives the metadata this *relevance* expression:

    selected(${crop_most}, '97')

## How to use

### Getting started

*To use this plug-in as is:*

1. Download the [sample form](https://github.com/surveycto/specify-other/raw/master/extras/sample-form/Specify%20other%20sample%20form.xlsx) from this repo, as well as the [media files ZIP file](https://github.com/surveycto/specify-other/raw/master/extras/sample-form/media.zip). You can use the sample form as-is, or adjust the parameters to change the behavior ([see below](#parameters)).
1. Download the [specify-other.fieldplugin.zip](https://github.com/surveycto/specify-other/raw/master/specify-other.fieldplugin.zip) file from this repo, and attach it to the sample form on your SurveyCTO server.
1. Upload the sample form to your server, with the media files ZIP file and the field plug-in attached.

Note: For simplicity, in the sample form, the field plug-in metadata is only retrieved for the first field. However, if multiple fields use this field plug-in, you can absolutely add multiple *calculate* fields that use the plug-in-metadata() function, so you can retrieve the "Other" data for each of those fields.

### Parameters

|Name|Description|
|:--|:--|
|`other` (optional)|The *value* of the choice where if it is selected, then the text box will appear. For example, if this parameter has a value of `'97'`, then when the choice with a *value* of "97" is selected, the text box will appear. If this parameter has no value, then the last choice in the choice list will be used.|
|`required` (optional)|Normally, if the text box appears, then the enumerator cannot move forward until they enter data into that text box. If this parameter has a value of `0`, then they can leave that text box blank, since it is not required; it will also say "(optional)" in the placeholder text.|
|`placeholder` (optional)|Custom placeholder text to show in the "Other" text box. Use an empty string (`''`) to show no placeholder. If not specified, uses the default SurveyCTO placeholder text or "Enter other response here..." in English. The text "(optional)" is automatically added to the placeholder when the `required` parameter is set to `0`. Supports field references like `${field_name}`.|

### Special circumstance: Leaving the text box blank

If you plan on giving the field with this field plug-in a [*required*](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/05.other-columns.html) value (different than the `required` parameter) of "no" or blank, check out our documentation on [leaving the text box blank](extras/other-docs/text-box-blank.md). If the field will always be *required*, then there is nothing to worry about.
